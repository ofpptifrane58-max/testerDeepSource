# testerDeepSource

This repository (`testerDeepSource`) contains a small React + Vite sample application used for testing and demonstration. It includes:

- A modern search example for foods
- A forms demo covering most HTML5 input types
- A simple data table that reads `public/data.json`

## About the template

This project was bootstrapped from the Vite React template and then extended with custom components and styles.

If you started from the Vite template, here are some references:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react)
- [Vite documentation](https://vite.dev)

You can run the project locally with:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173/` (or the port shown by Vite) to view the app.

If you need to restore the original Vite README content, re-add it from the Vite template or ask me to revert to the default template text.
